# PasswordGenerator
This program generates a number of random passwords using predefined characters, and then outputs the passwords to the console.

## Warning
Once the passwords are generated, they are printed to the console. After the console is closed, the passwords will no longerbe available. Once you generate your desired passwords, you must write them down.

There is little to no error-checking in this program. Also, be careful not to make passwords that are longer than the amount of available characters.

The characters that are available for a password are:
> abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789_-!
